Hello!

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my solution for the <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition.
If you run into any trouble with the setup/code or have any questions please contact me at <1136337803@qq.com>

#ARCHIVE CONTENTS
###exception_label: The solution that generates the exception label file.
###model1: The solution of model1.
###model2: The solution of model2.
###model3: The solution of model3.
###blend_of_model: Model blend.

#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
Kaggle kernel hardware

#SOFTWARE:
Kaggle kernel software

#OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:
It is recommended that the competition host reproduce the solution directly in the shared kaggle kernel. 
Here is the relevant code description:

##Note:
###All code should run in kaggle kernel and All kernels should import the <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition dataset. 
###Only after one kernel successfully runs and generates output files can it be imported into another kernel.

##Please open the folders in the following order and read the "readme.md" to reproduce the solution.
###1)model3
###2)exception_label
###3)model1
###4)model2
###5)blend_of_model
