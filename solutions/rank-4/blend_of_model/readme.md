Hello!

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my solution for the <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition.
If you run into any trouble with the setup/code or have any questions please contact me at <1136337803@qq.com>

#ARCHIVE CONTENTS
###as-leakage-replace-new.ipynb: Model blend.
###submission.csv: Final prediction file generated by the "as-leakage-replace-new" kernel.
###readme.md 

#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
Kaggle kernel hardware

#SOFTWARE:
Kaggle kernel software

#OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:
It is recommended that the competition host reproduce the solution directly in the shared kaggle kernel. 
Here is the relevant code description:

##Note:
###All code should run in kaggle kernel and All kernels should import the <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition dataset. 
###Only after one kernel successfully runs and generates output files can it be imported into another kernel.
###Before reproducing this solution, please make sure to successfully reproduce the "exception_label" solution. Make sure "exception_label/fork-of-ashrae-eda-exception-label5" runs successfully and generates output files. Of course, you can also directly use the same kernel that I shared in kaggle, the address is [https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-ashrae-eda-exception-label5](https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-ashrae-eda-exception-label5 "https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-ashrae-eda-exception-label5").
###Before reproducing this solution, please make sure to successfully reproduce the "model1" solution. Make sure "model1/fork-of-as-2kfold-model6-xgb-fr7d12-pred" runs successfully and generates output files. Of course, you can also directly use the same kernel that I shared in kaggle, the address is [https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-as-2kfold-model6-xgb-fr7d12-pred](https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-as-2kfold-model6-xgb-fr7d12-pred "https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-as-2kfold-model6-xgb-fr7d12-pred").
###Before reproducing this solution, please make sure to successfully reproduce the "model2" solution. Make sure "model2/as-meter2-no-1099-xgb" runs successfully and generates output files. Of course, you can also directly use the same kernel that I shared in kaggle, the address is [https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/as-meter2-no-1099-xgb](https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/as-meter2-no-1099-xgb "https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/as-meter2-no-1099-xgb").
###Before reproducing this solution, please make sure to successfully reproduce the "model3" solution. Make sure "model3/ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08" runs successfully and generates output files. Of course, you can also directly use the same  public kernel shared in kaggle, the address is [https://www.kaggle.com/aitude/ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08](https://www.kaggle.com/aitude/ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08 "https://www.kaggle.com/aitude/ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08").


##blend_of_model: Weighted blend of model1, model2 and model3.
###Please run the kernels in the following order. Only after one kernel successfully runs and generates output files can it be imported into another kernel.
####1) "as-leakage-replace-new.ipynb": Since this kernel depends on too many pre-public kernels and public data sets, it is recommended to use "Copy and Edit Kernel" to directly reproduce the same kernel I shared in Kaggle, the kernel address is [https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/as-leakage-replace-new](https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/as-leakage-replace-new "https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/as-leakage-replace-new")
- **input: <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition dataset, model2/ashrae-feather-format-for-fast-loading, model1/fork-of-as-2kfold-model6-xgb-fr7d12-pred, model2/as-meter2-no-1099-xgb, model3/ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08, ashrae-leak-data-station** 
- **output: submission.csv**
- **Note: "ashrae-leak-data-station" is a public kernel that depends on many public kernels and public data sets. The kernel address is [https://www.kaggle.com/yamsam/ashrae-leak-data-station](https://www.kaggle.com/yamsam/ashrae-leak-data-station "https://www.kaggle.com/yamsam/ashrae-leak-data-station"), please import it directly.**
