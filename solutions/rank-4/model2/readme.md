Hello!

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my solution for the <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition.
If you run into any trouble with the setup/code or have any questions please contact me at <1136337803@qq.com>

#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
Kaggle kernel hardware

#SOFTWARE:
Kaggle kernel software

#OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:
It is recommended that the competition host reproduce the solution directly in the shared kaggle kernel. 
Here is the relevant code description:

##Note:
###All code should run in kaggle kernel and All kernels should import the <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition dataset. 
###Only after one kernel successfully runs and generates output files can it be imported into another kernel.
###Before reproducing this solution, please make sure to successfully reproduce the "exception_label" solution. Make sure "exception_label/fork-of-ashrae-eda-exception-label5" runs successfully and generates output files. Of course, you can also directly use the same kernel that I shared in kaggle, the address is [https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-ashrae-eda-exception-label5](https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-ashrae-eda-exception-label5 "https://www.kaggle.com/firstbloody/fork-of-ashrae-eda-exception-label5").

##model2: A 5 folds XGBoost model trained by meter type, I call it model2.
###Please run the kernels in the following order. Only after one kernel successfully runs and generates output files can it be imported into another kernel.
####1) "ashrae-feather-format-for-fast-loading.ipynb": is a public kernel that can be imported directly into the later kernel. The original kernel address is [https://www.kaggle.com/corochann/ashrae-feather-format-for-fast-loading](https://www.kaggle.com/corochann/ashrae-feather-format-for-fast-loading "https://www.kaggle.com/corochann/ashrae-feather-format-for-fast-loading"). I downloaded the code "ashrae-feather-format-for-fast-loading.ipynb" from this address without making any changes.
