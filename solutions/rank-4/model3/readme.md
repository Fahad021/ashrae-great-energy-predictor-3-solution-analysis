Hello!

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my solution for the <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition.
If you run into any trouble with the setup/code or have any questions please contact me at <1136337803@qq.com>

#ARCHIVE CONTENTS
###ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08.ipynb: A 3 folds LightGBM model shared by a public kernel.I call it model3.
###submission.csv: Submission file generated by model3.
###readme.md

#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
Kaggle kernel hardware

#SOFTWARE:
Kaggle kernel software

#OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:
It is recommended that the competition host reproduce the solution directly in the shared kaggle kernel. 
Here is the relevant code description:

##Note:
#####All code should run in kaggle kernel and All kernels should import the <ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III> competition dataset.

##model3:(a 3 folds LightGBM model shared by a public kernel)
#####"ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08.ipynb": is a public kernel that can be imported directly into the later kernel. The original kernel address is [https://www.kaggle.com/aitude/ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08](https://www.kaggle.com/aitude/ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08 "https://www.kaggle.com/aitude/ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08"). I downloaded the code "ashrae-kfold-lightgbm-without-leak-1-08.ipynb" and output file "submission.csv" from this address without making any changes.
